HotbarPets is a Slimefun4 Addon that is heavily inspired by the famous mod [InventoryPets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/inventory-pets).
It adds new items to Slimefun that act like "Pets".
If you carry them in your Hotbar they can prevent you from taking certain types of damage, give you free items or Potion Effects.
But only if you also carry their favourite food with you.
